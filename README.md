# Solid Rocket Motor V1.0

## Overview
This repository documents the design, analysis, manufacturing planning, and test preparation of a solid rocket motor developed under the Liberty University Rocketry program.  
All work contained herein represents my individual technical contributions to the project.

The intent of this repository is to demonstrate engineering methodology, analytical rigor, and documentation practices appropriate for an undergraduate propulsion-focused design project.

## Project Objectives
- Design a flight-capable solid rocket motor meeting thrust and burn time requirements  
- Perform first-order and higher-fidelity propulsion analyses  
- Develop manufacturing drawings and process documentation
- Manufacture in-house all components
- Plan a compliant and instrumented static test campaign  
- Maintain traceable engineering documentation suitable for review and iteration  

## Contents
- `analysis/` – Analytical models, hand calculations, and performance evaluations  
- `cad/` – Mechanical design files, drawings, and assemblies  
- `documents/` – Design reports, requirements, and supporting documentation  
- `manufacturing/` – Manufacturing plans, tooling concepts, and process documentation  
- `simulations/` – Numerical simulations and supporting models  
- `testing/` – Test planning, instrumentation layouts, and data analysis  

## Motor Summary
| Parameter | Value |
|---------|------|
| Propellant | RNX-71V |
| Chamber Pressure | 4.136 MPa |
| Nominal Thrust | 1200 N |
| Burn Time | 4 s |
